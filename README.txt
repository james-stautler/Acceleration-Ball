ACCELERATION BALL README - James Stautler


Basic python project using pygame module

To play, use the arrow keys to move the bar at the bottom to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom; each hit on the bar will increase the player's score while simultaneously increasing the ball's speed to raise difficulty.
